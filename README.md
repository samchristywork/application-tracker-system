## Overview

This is a web application that I will use to track job applications. This
server will store metadata on each application, along with the résumé and
cover letters that I submit to them.

## Setup

To run this server you first need to install all of the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then, start the server with:

```
node main.js
```

## Dependencies

You'll need to have Node.js installed for this to work.

```
nodejs
npm
```
